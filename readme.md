> before you get started, you need `brew`: [macos](https://brew.sh/) | [linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)

## commands

You'll be prompted for a trello key - generate one [here](https://trello.com/app-key/)

> NOTE: If `make` doesn't work, try `brew bundle`.

### `default` : run the cli

```sh
make CMD=<your:command>
```

  - `trello:rollup` :: count up the number of recent cards by label
  - `trello:reset` :: delete all recent cards and create new ones based on the templates in `config`
  - `file:checkup` :: copy a "checkup" template, open relevant resources for filling the template
  - `file:accounting` :: copy an "accounting" template, open relevant resources for filling the template

```sh
make branch NAME=<your-branch>
```
